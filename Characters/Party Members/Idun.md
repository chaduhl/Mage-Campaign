## Awakening

- Awakened as an intern at a huge company 
- Happened at a meeting with high profile people
- At the meetings, she was given an envelope (as were others) with an address and told by the CEO of [[Avalon Industries]] that she must do _something_ with that information within 8 hours
- Drove to the address with her mom’s car
- Ended up at a house, inside was a view she saw in her little brothers games
- By happenstance, she introduced herself as god/another Angel to Leo
- Leo remains convinced of this to this day
- She had heard about magic in her family, so she connected this experience to that familial lore
- She heard a voice that says ”end it”, so she snaps her fingers and it ends
